# Mibiib2.0 OS
What is Mibiib2.0? Mibiib2.0 is a combination effort between human and artificial intelligence to develop a working, functional kernel, equivalent to early versions of Linux, and operating system equivalent to MCC Interim Linux 0.95

Mibiib is the Operating System, and is built ontop of the Lynx kernel. No, I did not just take Linux and bastardize it. Lynx are cool.

Mibiib and the Lynx kernel are developed by S. Lindorff, in combination with a free version Gemini 3 Pro Preview, and the free version of ChatGPT.

Mibiib is not intended to be used as a real Operating System at this time.

# How to build/use:

Run the make file. It should spit out a Grub ISO. The make file has a test command which uses QEMU.
